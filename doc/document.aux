Reads from a mock control data set were mapped onto the human genome and pooled in 300\nobreakspace  {}bp windows after removing duplicates. The histogram of the read counts is shown in black (no immunoprecipitation was performed in this experiment, so this variation corresponds to the `baseline'). The colored histograms show the maximum likelihood fit of the Poisson, Negative Binomial (NB) and Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) distributions. The fit of the Poisson distribution is poor. The NB distribution gives a good fit at the tail, but not for windows with 0 and 1 read. The ZINB distribution gives a good fit over the whole range. Data from ENCODE file ENCFF000VEK. }}{1}}

The size of the circles is proportional to the coverage of the targets, and their overlap approximates the amount of targets shared by the programs.
